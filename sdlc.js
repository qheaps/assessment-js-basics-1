// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = `Goes into more specifics on the features decided on in planning, specifying technical details and feasibility of discussed features.`
const design = `Determines if the planned features fulfill requirements, and decides on the best languages to implement planned features.`
const implementation = `The actual creation of software inplementing the planned features.`
const testingAndIntegration = `The testing of the created software to ensure it functions correctly, as well as the possible integration of the completed features into an existing code base.`
const maintain = `The maintenance of completed software to ensure that it remains functional and up to date.`
